his project is a basic web application that lets users enter their name and age using a simple form. When the form is submitted, the data is saved into a MySQL database. All records are then shown in a table below the form.

Each row in the table has a toggle button that can change the status value between 0 and 1. When the button is clicked, the status updates instantly without reloading the page, using AJAX.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. It is useful for learning how to connect front-end forms with a back-end database, and how to update data dynamically.
